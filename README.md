# C++ Courses and Practice

This repository is a template of different C++ themes. These are based on the [C++ Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-for-programmers--ud210) free MOOC and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

## Description

C++ is a programming language used in all sort of modern applications. The speed and low-level control that is provided by it stands out from other languages. 

This repository is arranged in two subfolders. The first one is the Udacity Course and this is called [Cpp_course](https://github.com/MikeS96/hackerrang_cpp/tree/master/Cpp_course). The following topics are used and explained:

 - C++ Basics
 - Arithmetic
 - Loops 
 - Pointers
 - Arrays
 - Functions
 - Classes
 - Overloading
 - Templates
 - Inheritance 
 - Polymorphism
 - Vectors

In a similar fashion, the folder [hackerrank_practice](https://github.com/MikeS96/hackerrang_cpp/tree/master/hackerrank_practice) provides solutions to some of the basic challenges provided in HackerRank. Most of the topics are the same than those provided in the Udacity MOOC.
